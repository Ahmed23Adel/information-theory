 Lossless compression algorithms highly depend on probability of each symbol and assign fewer codes for symbols with higher probability.

Here I implemented both Huffman and Arithmetic encoding; using python.

One disadvantage of Huffman is that it needs to know all probabilities of al codes before encoding, but it's solved in arithmetic encoding, as it can encode any stream, with dynamic probably
